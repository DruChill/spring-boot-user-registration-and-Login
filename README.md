# spring-boot-user-registration-and-Login

What weâ€™ll build?

We will build two main functionalities:

Register user (stored data into MySQL database). 
Login Authentication - validate user login credentials with database email and password. 
We will secure the Registered Users Page with role-based Spring Security.
